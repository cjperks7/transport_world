NOTE: Using profiletools out of Mark Chilenski's directory requires
utilizing python2.7

An appropriate environment has already been created under:
/home/cjperks/active_profiles2

Modules:
    numpy==1.10.4
    scipy==0.17.0
    emcee==2.1.0
    mpmath==0.19
    matplotlib==1.5.3

python2.7 versions of profiletools, eqtools, and gptools can be found under:
/home/sciortino/usr/pythonmodules/

To do fits using the GUI:
    . /home/cjperks/activate_profiles2              -> python2.7 environment
    cd /home/cjperks/profiletools/profiletools      -> source code
    /home/cjperks/profiletools/bin/gpfit            -> launch GUI
        NOTE: seems to source code from
            /home/markchil/codes/

Apparently, as of May 2019, these are the recommended Gibbs fit parameters
gibbs_params={'sigma_min':0.0, 'sigma_max':10.0,
    'l1_mean':1.0, 'l2_mean':0.5, 'lw_mean':0.01, 'x0_mean':1.0,
    'l1_sd':3.0, 'l2_sd':3.0, 'lw_sd':0.1, 'x0_sd':0.05}


How to use the GPfit GUI:
1. Data page
    Add shot
    Add signal
    Add coordinate
    Add diag
    Add time window to average over

    Load Data
    Plot Data --> Will get error if diag was unavailable

2. Kernel page

3. Fit page
    Outlier Rejection --
    Plot indices --> index of points
    Remove points --> list of point indices to exclude

    Fit Data
    Save Fit --> writes fit to NetCDF
        NOTE: one NetCDF file per steady-state profile (ne/Te/Ti)
        Convenently remembers what folder you want to put stuff

4. Plot
    Plot limits
