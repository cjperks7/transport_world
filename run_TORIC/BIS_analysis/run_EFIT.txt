For the break-in-slope analysis, one needs to calculate global plasma
parameters derived via an EFIT calculation on a fast time scale ~1ms

The DAQ of the magnetics diagnostics operated at a 5kHz (0.2ms)
sampling speed


NOTE: Because EFIT data at C-Mod is traditionally stored on 
dedicated "trees" for certain PIs, we are using an altered
workflow prepared by Lucas Spahngher as described in:
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gXMMPZYrvhlROiewkYeP1KxawFfdxwwvSuFuA-Q5Iyc/edit#slide=id.p

The EFIT executable is stored at:
/usr/local/cmod/codes/efit/bin/

NOTE: You will need to "ssh -X mferws04" to have access to the EFIT executable
The -X is needed in case Matlab makes a login pop up
The mfewsXX's don't have this directory anymore for whatever reason


### ---- Step 1: env setup for rerunning EFIT ---- ###

1.1 Make sure in pwd there's a further directory called "trees"
to write all output into


1.2 Create (or copy) three EFIT template files:
<efit tree name>_model.{datafile, characteristics, tree}

Templates for "efit_cjp_model.*" can be found under:
/home/cjperks/transport_world/run_TORIC/BIS_analysis

NOTE: The model files must be copied into pwd/trees/


1.3 Copy an example .cvs input file into pwd

An example input file for this Matlab code is stored under:
/home/cjperks/transport_world/run_TORIC/BIS_analysis/time_to_run_shots_all_1.csv

Lucas' code was ||-ized to run many shots for the disruptions group
What is needed is a list of the shot, start time [s], and end time [s]
appended under the Header line


1.4 Copy run_efit_cjp.m into pwd
An example input file is stored under:
/home/cjperks/transport_world/run_TORC/BIS_analysis/run_efit_cjp.m

NOTE: within run_efit_cjp.m, there's a variable "dt" controlling the EFIT
time resolutions


### ---- Step 2: Rerunning EFIT ---- ###

Relevant files: run_efit_cjp.m

2.1 Run Matlab code using:
matlab -nodesktop -nosplash
run_efit_cjp

NOTE: This code will set a specficially named path variable in your system
setenv('efit_cjp_path', tree_dir)
tree_dir = directory that you want your trees to go into

NOTE: This code will automatically run EFIT with mode=9 (continuous run)

2.2 The output of this code will be written under pwd/trees/ as
efit_cjp_shot#.{datafile, characteristics, tree}


### ---- Step 3: Reading EFIT results ---- ###

3.1 To use MDSplus to read a local EFIT tree results, see:
/home/cjperks/transport_world/run_TORIC/BIS_analysis/scripts/get_wplasma.py

NOTE: instead of using os.environ[]..., one can also use:
export efit_cjp_path=$PWD

3.2 Making an geqdsk file, first set enviroment path in terminal
export efit_cjp_path=$PWD (in the /trees directory)
write_eqdsk, shot#, time#[ms], tree='efit_cjp'
